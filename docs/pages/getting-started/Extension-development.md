# Extension development

  <div class="ps-3 ms-3"><b>Developer mode</b> has to be turned on in your <b>admin panel</b> <p- class="opacity-50">(Admin > Extensions > Blueprint)</p-> before you can run developer commands. You only have to do this once.</div>
</div><br/>

### **Quick start**
Get started by beginning from a template, naming and describing your extension through the initialize command.
```sh
blueprint -init
```
When choosing a template, select `Barebones` to be able to follow along with this guide. Most options can be changed later, so don't procrastinate too much thinking of an extension name.

After running this command, you can now find your extension files in the `.blueprint/dev` directory (which is located inside of your Pterodactyl folder). You can use cd to change to this directory.
```sh
cd .blueprint/dev
```
<br>


### **Applying changes**
To apply any changes you've made and preview them on your panel, run the following developer command. This command installs extension files from `.blueprint/dev/` like it were a normal extension.
```sh
blueprint -build
```
